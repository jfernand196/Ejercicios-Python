# Given the root node of a binary search tree and two integers low and high, return the sum of values 
# of all nodes with a value in the inclusive range [low, high].
# Input: root = [10,5,15,3,7,null,18], low = 7, high = 15
# Output: 32
# Explanation: Nodes 7, 10, and 15 are in the range [7, 15]. 7 + 10 + 15 = 32.
root = [10,5,15,3,7,null,18]
low = 7
high = 15

# print(root[5])
print(root.val))
#[i for i in root if i != 'null']
# print([i for i in root if i is not None])
